## Quick Notes from the book "The Staff Engineer's path"

### The Pillars of Staff Engineering
* Big-picture thinking
    * Seeing beyond the immediate details
    * Understanding the context that you're working in.
    * Initiating yearlong projects, building software that will be easy to decommision or predicting what your company will need in three years
* Execution
    * The projects you at at this level will become messier and more ambigious
    * They'll involve more people and need more political capital, influence or culture change to succeed. 
* Levelling up
    * Intentional influnece through teaching and mentoring
    * Accidental influence that comes from being a role model
